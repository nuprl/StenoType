# Fine-tuning

Here, we showcase how we can fine-tune this LM on a specific downstream task.

## Step by step installation with conda 

Create a new conda environment and activate it
```bash
conda create -n env
conda activate env
```
Install the `pytorch` version compatible with your version of cuda [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/), for example the following command works with cuda 11.6
```bash
conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```
Install `transformers` and `peft`
```bash
conda install -c huggingface transformers 
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/peft.git
```
Note that you can install the latest stable version of transformers by using

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
```

Install `datasets`, `accelerate` and `huggingface_hub`

```bash
conda install -c huggingface -c conda-forge datasets
conda install -c conda-forge accelerate
conda install -c conda-forge huggingface_hub
```

Finally, install `bitsandbytes` and `wandb`
```bash
pip install bitsandbytes
pip install wandb
```
To get the full list of arguments with descriptions you can run the following command on any script:
```
python scripts/some_script.py --help
```
Before you run any of the scripts make sure you are logged in and can push to the hub:
```bash
huggingface-cli login
```
Make sure you are logged in `wandb`:
```bash
wandb login
```
Now that everything is done, you can clone the repository and get into the corresponding directory.

## Datasets
ðŸ’« StarCoder can be fine-tuned to achieve multiple downstream tasks. Our interest here is to fine-tune StarCoder in order to make it follow instructions. [Instruction fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01652.pdf) has gained a lot of attention recently as it proposes a simple framework that teaches language models to align their outputs with human needs. That procedure requires the availability of quality instruction datasets, which contain multiple `instruction - answer` pairs. Unfortunately such datasets are not ubiquitous but thanks to Hugging Face ðŸ¤—'s [datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library we can have access to some good proxies. To fine-tune cheaply and efficiently, we use Hugging Face ðŸ¤—'s [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) as well as Tim Dettmers' [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes).


### Stack Exchange SE
[Stack Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange) is a well-known network of Q&A websites on topics in diverse fields. It is a place where a user can ask a question and obtain answers from other users. Those answers are scored and ranked based on their quality. [Stack exchange instruction](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ArmelR/stack-exchange-instruction) is a dataset that was obtained by scrapping the site in order to build a collection of Q&A pairs. A language model can then be fine-tuned on that dataset to make it elicit strong and diverse question-answering skills.

To execute the fine-tuning script run the following command:
```bash
python finetune/finetune.py \
  --model_path="bigcode/starcoder"\
  --dataset_name="ArmelR/stack-exchange-instruction"\
  --subset="data/finetune"\
  --split="train"\
  --size_valid_set 10000\
  --streaming\
  --seq_length 2048\
  --max_steps 1000\
  --batch_size 1\
  --input_column_name="question"\
  --output_column_name="response"\ 
  --gradient_accumulation_steps 16\
  --learning_rate 1e-4\
  --lr_scheduler_type="cosine"\
  --num_warmup_steps 100\
  --weight_decay 0.05\
  --output_dir="./checkpoints" \
```
The size of the SE dataset is better manageable when using streaming. We also have to precise the split of the dataset that is used. For more details, check the [dataset's page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ArmelR/stack-exchange-instruction) on ðŸ¤—. Similarly we can modify the command to account for the availability of GPUs

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch \
  --nproc_per_node number_of_gpus finetune/finetune.py \
  --model_path="bigcode/starcoder"\
  --dataset_name="ArmelR/stack-exchange-instruction"\
  --subset="data/finetune"\
  --split="train"\
  --size_valid_set 10000\
  --streaming \
  --seq_length 2048\
  --max_steps 1000\
  --batch_size 1\
  --input_column_name="question"\
  --output_column_name="response"\ 
  --gradient_accumulation_steps 16\
  --learning_rate 1e-4\
  --lr_scheduler_type="cosine"\
  --num_warmup_steps 100\
  --weight_decay 0.05\
  --output_dir="./checkpoints" \
```
## Merging PEFT adapter layers
If you train a model with PEFT, you'll need to merge the adapter layers with the base model if you want to run inference / evaluation. To do so, run:
```bash
python finetune/merge_peft_adapters.py --base_model_name_or_path model_to_merge --peft_model_path model_checkpoint

# Push merged model to the Hub
python finetune/merge_peft_adapters.py --base_model_name_or_path model_to_merge --peft_model_path model_checkpoint --push_to_hub
```
For example

```bash
python finetune/merge_peft_adapters.py --model_name_or_path bigcode/starcoder --peft_model_path checkpoints/checkpoint-1000 --push_to_hub
```
